# hello-world

Hi Folks,
i want to write a program, which can analyze historical source material and, mark keywords, show etymological meanings of the words,
depending on the historical context.

What it should do:
a) it should have the function to integrate text.
b) it should have different colours for different meanings of words: f.e. time-related meaning (blue), use of common-language (green),
and so on. 
c) it should give time-related information and who created the source material, f.e. a speech or governemental paper (decision).

This program is aimed to help students to work more efficient on source material, in order to analyze text better and use the information
for their essays.

The first title of the program is "WordWeb".

Thanks!
